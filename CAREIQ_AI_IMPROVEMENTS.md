## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Content Filtering
```typescript
MUST RESPOND TO:
‚úÖ Nursing home regulations and compliance
‚úÖ CMS F-Tags and survey preparation
‚úÖ Clinical care and resident assessment
‚úÖ Staff training and operations
‚úÖ Quality assurance and safety

MUST NOT RESPOND TO:
‚ùå Personal problems or counseling
‚ùå Political or social issues
‚ùå Entertainment or pop culture
‚ùå Financial/legal advice (beyond regulations)
‚ùå Harmful or dangerous content
‚ùå Off-topic academic work
```

### Redirect Example
When user asks about off-topic subjects:
> "I'm specialized exclusively in nursing home compliance and operations. I'm not able to help with [topic]. However, I'd be happy to assist you with any questions about nursing home regulations, resident care, survey preparation, or facility operations. How can I help you in those areas?"
