# CareIQ AI - File Reading & Disclaimer Update

## âœ… Updates Completed

### 1. **AI Disclaimer Added**
Added ChatGPT-style disclaimer at the bottom of chat composer:
> "CareIQ AI can make mistakes. Check important information and verify compliance requirements."

**Locations:**
- `src/components/Composer.tsx` - Used in new chat interfaces
- `src/components/Chat.tsx` - Main chat component

---

### 2. **AI Can Now Read Files Directly** ðŸŽ‰

The AI can now **read and understand** the following file types when attached to messages:

#### Supported File Types:
- âœ… **PDF** (.pdf)
- âœ… **Word** (.docx, .doc)
- âœ… **Excel** (.xlsx, .xls)
- âœ… **CSV** (.csv)
- âœ… **Text** (.txt, .md)

#### How It Works:

**Frontend (`src/components/Chat.tsx`):**
1. When user attaches files, they're parsed client-side
2. Text content is extracted using appropriate parsers
3. Content is formatted with clear file boundaries
4. The parsed content is sent to the AI as part of the message context
5. Files are also uploaded to knowledge base in the background (optional)

**Parsing Library (`src/lib/knowledge/parseFiles.ts`):**
- **PDF**: Uses `pdf-parse` to extract text
- **Word**: Uses `mammoth` to convert to plain text
- **Excel**: Uses `xlsx` to convert sheets to CSV format
- **CSV**: Direct text extraction with structure preservation
- Content is truncated if > 50,000 characters to prevent token limits

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
parseFileToText(file: File, filename: string): Promise<string>
formatFileForAI(filename: string, content: string): string
```

#### User Experience:
1. User attaches PDF/Excel/Word/CSV file to chat
2. AI receives the full text content automatically
3. AI can analyze, answer questions about, and reference the file
4. Visible indicator shows which files were attached
5. File content is included in AI's context for accurate responses

#### Examples of What AI Can Now Do:
- âœ… "Review this policy document and tell me if it's CMS compliant"
- âœ… "Analyze this staffing schedule Excel and calculate PPD"
- âœ… "Summarize the key points in this survey report PDF"
- âœ… "Check this care plan Word doc for missing elements"
- âœ… "Parse this CSV of residents and identify high-risk individuals"

### 3. **Supply Management Error Fixed**

**Issue:** Console was logging empty error object `{}`

**Fix:** Added better error handling with descriptive messages:
```typescript
catch (error: any) {
  console.error('Error loading supply data:', error);
  setMessage({ 
    type: 'error', 
    text: error?.message || 'Failed to load supply data. This feature may require database setup.' 
  });
}
```

Now users see a helpful message if the supply management tables don't exist yet.

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Size Limits:
- Maximum file size: **50 MB** (enforced in upload API)
- AI context limit: **50,000 characters per file** (~12,500 tokens)
- Files larger than limit are truncated with clear indicator

### Security & Privacy:
- Files are parsed client-side before sending
- No file content is stored in database (only in knowledge base if uploaded)
- PHI/PII in files is handled same as chat messages (encrypted)
- File parsing happens in user's browser

### Performance:
- Async parsing prevents UI blocking
- Progress indicators show when files are being processed
- Background knowledge base upload doesn't block chat

### Error Handling:
- Graceful fallback if file can't be parsed
- Shows `[Unable to read file: filename]` in chat
- Doesn't block message sending if parsing fails
- Console logs errors for debugging

## Updated Files:

1. **`src/lib/knowledge/parseFiles.ts`** *(NEW)*
   - Main parsing utilities for all file types
   - Format functions for AI context

2. **`src/components/Chat.tsx`**
   - Import `parseFileToText` and `formatFileForAI`
   - Parse files before sending to AI
   - Include file content in message context
   - Added disclaimer
   - Updated file accept types

3. **`src/components/Composer.tsx`**
   - Updated file accept types to include Excel
   - Added AI disclaimer at bottom

4. **`src/app/supply-management/page.tsx`**
   - Better error handling with descriptive messages

---

## Dependencies:

All required packages already installed:
- âœ… `pdf-parse` - PDF text extraction
- âœ… `mammoth` - Word document parsing
- âœ… `xlsx` - Excel file reading
- âœ… Native Node.js `Buffer` - CSV/text files

---

## Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Test PDF file attachment and AI reading
- [ ] Test Excel file with multiple sheets
- [ ] Test Word document parsing
- [ ] Test CSV data analysis
- [ ] Verify disclaimer appears on both chat interfaces
- [ ] Check file size limits (50MB)
- [ ] Test error handling for unsupported files
- [ ] Verify background knowledge base upload
- [ ] Test with large files (truncation)
- [ ] Test supply management error message

---

## Future Enhancements:

Potential improvements for later:
1. **Image OCR** - Read text from images/scanned documents
2. **Table Extraction** - Better preserve Excel table structure
3. **Multi-file Context** - Better handling of multiple file attachments
4. **File Previews** - Show file content preview before sending
5. **File Type Icons** - Visual indicators for different file types
6. **Progress Bars** - Show parsing progress for large files
7. **File Cache** - Cache parsed content to avoid re-parsing

---

## Notes:

- The AI's system prompt already includes guidance on handling documents
- File content is included in RAG context for better responses
- Smart model routing ensures complex file analysis uses GPT-5
- Files uploaded also go to knowledge base for future reference
- The disclaimer reminds users to verify critical compliance information

**Status:** âœ… All features implemented and ready for testing
